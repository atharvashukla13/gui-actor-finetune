# GUI Actor Fine-tuning

This project provides scripts and modules for fine-tuning a GUI Actor model for patch labeling tasks.

## How it works

- Define your model in `gui_actor/model.py`
- Load and preprocess your dataset with `gui_actor/dataset.py`
- Configure training parameters in `data_config.yaml`
- Run the main script `fine_tune_gui_actor.py` to start training
